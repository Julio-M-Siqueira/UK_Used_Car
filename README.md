# Company Background
Discount Motors is a used car dealership in the UK. They want to lead the way in used cars.
Selling to customers who want the latest and greatest features, without the price tag of a
brand new car.

# Project goal
To fill the gap that the retiring employee will leave, we need to create a model that can
predict the selling value of used vehicles.
